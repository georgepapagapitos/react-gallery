# React Gallery

## Description

Duration: Weekend Challenge

The task was to create an image gallery that allows a user to add, delete, and like images.  There is an input form that receives inputs from
the user and sends that data to a local database, and then displays the image in the gallery.
Each image will toggle when clicked, showing the description.
Each image also allows a user to click a heart to 'love' the image and the total 'loves' are counted and displayed.
There is also a corresponding delete button that allows the user to delete an image from the gallery and the database.
